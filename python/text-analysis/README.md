# Reverie Text Analysis Tool 

This tool helps you analyze text using a powerful online service. You can do things like:

* **Translate text:** Change text from one language to another.
* **Summarize text:** Get a shorter version of a long piece of text.
* **Detect entities:** Identify important things in the text, like people, places, and organizations.
* **Check for safety:** See if the text contains any harmful or inappropriate content.
* **Hide personal information:** Automatically remove or replace things like names and addresses.

**Think of it like a magic text analyzer!**

## What You Need Before You Start

Before you can use this tool, you need a few things:

1.  **A Computer:** This tool runs on a computer.
2.  **Internet Connection:** It needs to connect to the internet to work.
3.  **Python Installed:** Python is a programming language that this tool is written in. If you don't have it, you might need to install it. You can usually download it from the official Python website (search for "download Python").
4.  **API Key and App ID:** This is like a special password that lets you use the online text analysis service. You will need to get these from the company that provides the service (Reverie). You'll usually sign up on their website to get these. **Look for where to get your API Key and App ID after you sign up.**

## How to Set Up the Tool

1.  **Save the Code:** Copy all the text in the box above (the one that starts with `import requests`) and save it in a file on your computer. You can name the file something like `text_analyzer.py`. Make sure the file ends with `.py`.

2.  **Enter Your API Key and App ID:**
    * Open the file you just saved (`text_analyzer.py`) using a simple text editor (like Notepad on Windows or TextEdit on Mac).
    * Look for these lines in the code:
        ```python
        API_KEY = "<YOUR-API-KEY>"
        APP_ID = "<YOUR-APP-ID>"
        ```
    * **Carefully replace** `<YOUR-API-KEY>` with the actual API key you got from Reverie. **Make sure to keep the quotation marks around it.**
    * **Carefully replace** `<YOUR-APP-ID>` with the actual App ID you got from Reverie. **Again, keep the quotation marks.**
    * After replacing, these lines might look something like this (with your actual keys):
        ```python
        API_KEY = "your_actual_api_key_here"
        APP_ID = "your_actual_app_id_here"
        ```
    * Save the changes to the file.

## How to Use the Tool

1.  **Open a Terminal or Command Prompt:**
    * **Windows:** Press the Windows key, type `cmd`, and press Enter.
    * **Mac:** Open the "Terminal" application (you can find it in the "Utilities" folder within "Applications").

2.  **Go to the Folder:** Use the `cd` command to navigate to the folder where you saved the `text_analyzer.py` file. For example, if you saved it in a folder called "MyScripts" on your Desktop, you would type:
    * **Windows:** `cd Desktop\MyScripts`
    * **Mac:** `cd Desktop/MyScripts`
    * (You might need to adjust the path depending on where you saved the file.)

3.  **Run the Tool:** Once you are in the correct folder, you can run the tool using the following command:

    ```bash
    python text_analyzer.py
    ```

    This will run the Python script. You should see some output on the screen.

## Understanding the Example

Look at the last part of the code in the file:

```python
# Example Usage
try:
    result = analyze_text("<YOUR-TEXT-HERE>", "<SOURCE-LANGUAGE>", "<TARGET-LANGUAGE>")
    print("Analysis Result:", result)
except Exception as e:
    print(e)
